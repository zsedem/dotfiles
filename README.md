## My message to you
Hi,

So you happened to look at my configurations, it is not intended to be 
working with other username than zsedem or other os than Arch Linux, so
but I think you find a lots of useful stuff here, either the vim or tmux
configuration or just ideas how to manage your configurations.

You will find a program which creates my bash prompt written in haskell,
you may also find a really big XMonad 'configuration' which i think its
rather a window manager written in haskell with the awesome library called
XMonad :).

This repository driven by two need i have:
  * Automate everything
    * I try to automate every repetitive click i have on my workflows,
      however this approach takes just as much time, i guess.
  * Use haskell as much as i can
    * Haskell has everything you need for writing any kind of enterprise
      software, which you want to maintain for years. The only thing it
      misses, that the big community all around a world, which would make
      the googling on Haskell more easy, so think of this repository as
      my part in making the community of Haskell bigger.

Let me know if you have any suggestions or just you used something of it.

Zsiga
